# Python scripts

## Capacity calculations

This script contains some elements to easily calculate the capacity of series and parallel capacitors. I used it to investigate the possibilitys to reach the exact needed capacity for experiment 10 ("Versuch 10"). However this is not required to do for the experiment.

## Data extraction

Because of Covid-19 the experiments were partly converted to simulation experiments using the software [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html#). This software simulates the experiment and produces output in *.log* files. To extract the needed information to e.g. plot graphs (which I used [OriginPro](https://www.originlab.com/) for) I wrote this script.
